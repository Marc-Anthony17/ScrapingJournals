The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected.

We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p .

All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD\u200a=\u200a1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. '}",Todo,"{'Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N =\u200a39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N\u200a= 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N =\u200a14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ =\u200amutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f =\u200aeffective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum\u200a=\u200a0.0, maximum\u200a=\u200a0.1, mean\u200a=\u200a0.01; M distribution: minimum\u200a=\u200a0.000001, maximum\u200a=\u200a1000, mean\u200a=\u200a100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval\u200a=\u200a1; four chains with start temperatures\u200a=\u200a1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ\u200a=\u200a0.03 for Θ; Δ\u200a=\u200a110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ\u200a=\u200a0.06 for Θ; Δ\u200a=\u200a250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean\u200a=\u200a−0.70) and positive for males (mean\u200a=\u200a0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).

Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

Laboratory populations were reared from these cyst samples. We assessed the reproductive mode of each population using a sex ratio criterion [29] and whenever the original cyst samples contained an additional sexual species (see Table 1 ), we obtained pure laboratory parthenogenetic populations using morphometric methods (for culture conditions and other details see [29] ). Cyst samples from Asiatic sexual species were also obtained from the same cyst bank collection, including A . urmiana from Urmia lake and from Koyashskoe lake, A. tibetiana from four lakes of the Tibetan plateau (Lagkor Co, Gaize, Hayan, Jingyu), an undescribed sexual Artemia population from Kazakhstan (originally Artemia Reference Center code - ARC 1039, unknown locality) and A. sinica from Yuncheng (China) ( Figure 1 ).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

Nuclear loci summary of polymorphic sites in each Artemia population. A dash means that heterozygote individuals were found, a forward slash indicate that the position is polymorphic in the population, with both homozygote and heterozygotes found. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083348.t003   Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses  The COI fragment was sequenced in 258 individuals, 165 of which were diploid parthenogens (see Table 2 ). For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

The topology inferred by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method using HKY model is shown. Bayesian (BA) phylogenetic reconstruction showed a very similar topology. The ML bootstrap values higher than 50 are shown below the branch, and the Bayesian support values over 90% are shown above the branch. Haplotypes found in each population are shown, with population codes corresponding to those listed in Table 3 .
