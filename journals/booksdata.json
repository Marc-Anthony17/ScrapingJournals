Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Map shows the countries for which available sequences from HIV-1B infected patients were available (colored), and the number of sequences per country (n). Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. ", "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2.

The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p .

All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Map shows the countries for which available sequences from HIV-1B infected patients were available (colored), and the number of sequences per country (n). Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2.

The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p .

All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Map shows the countries for which available sequences from HIV-1B infected patients were available (colored), and the number of sequences per country (n). Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

Laboratory populations were reared from these cyst samples. We assessed the reproductive mode of each population using a sex ratio criterion [29] and whenever the original cyst samples contained an additional sexual species (see Table 1 ), we obtained pure laboratory parthenogenetic populations using morphometric methods (for culture conditions and other details see [29] ). Cyst samples from Asiatic sexual species were also obtained from the same cyst bank collection, including A . urmiana from Urmia lake and from Koyashskoe lake, A. tibetiana from four lakes of the Tibetan plateau (Lagkor Co, Gaize, Hayan, Jingyu), an undescribed sexual Artemia population from Kazakhstan (originally Artemia Reference Center code - ARC 1039, unknown locality) and A. sinica from Yuncheng (China) ( Figure 1 ).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

Nuclear loci summary of polymorphic sites in each Artemia population.

For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

However, few ochre processing tools, ochre containers, and ochre-stained artefacts from MSA contexts have been studied in detail within a theoretical framework aimed at inferring the technical steps involved in the acquisition, production and use of these artefacts. Here we analyse 21 ochre processing tools, i.e. upper and lower grindstones, and two ochre-stained artefacts from the MSA layers of Porc-Epic Cave, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, dated to ca. 40 cal kyr BP. These tools, and a large proportion of the 4213 ochre fragments found at the site, were concentrated in an area devoted to ochre processing. Lower grindstones are made of a variety of raw materials, some of which are not locally available. Traces of use indicate that different techniques were employed to process ochre. Optical microscopy, XRD, μ-Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-EDS analyses of residues preserved on worn areas of artefacts show that different types of ferruginous rocks were processed in order to produce ochre powder of different coarseness and shades. A round stone bearing no traces of having been used to process ochre is half covered with residues as if it had been dipped in a liquid ochered medium to paint the object or to use it as a stamp to apply pigment to a soft material. We argue that the ochre reduction sequences identified at Porc-Epic Cave reflect a high degree of behavioural complexity, and represent ochre use, which was probably devoted to a variety of functions.", "citations": "Rosso DE, Pitarch Martí A, d’Errico F (2016) Middle Stone Age Ochre Processing and Behavioural Complexity in the Horn of Africa: Evidence from Porc-Epic Cave, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.

It is situated 3 km south of Dire Dawa (Ethiopia), near the top of the Garad Erer hill, 140 m above the wadi Laga Dächatu, and opens at the base of a Jurassic limestone cliff. In 1929, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Henry de Monfreid discovered the site and carried out an initial survey that identified the presence of Palaeolithic levels [ 85 ] and rock art of a \"later schematic style\" [ 36 , 86 ]. The excavation was extended by Henri Breuil and Paul Wernert in 1933 [ 87 ] and by John Desmond Clark in 1974 [ 36 , 88 ]. In 1975–1976, the trench excavated by Desmond Clark was enlarged by Kenneth D. Williamson, covering an area of approximately 49 m 2 . In 1998, new data on Porc-Epic’s stratigraphic sequence were collected during fieldwork conducted by a team from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle , Paris, and the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH) of Ethiopia [ 89 ].

The arrow indicates the entrance of the cave; c: view of the cave from its entrance (photo A. Herrero).  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g001 The stratigraphy of the site ( Fig 2 ) shows a succession of clayish, sandy levels and breccia, which were divided into seven stratigraphic units [ 36 , 37 ]. MSA artefacts were present between 60 and 220–230 cm below datum. According to Desmond Clark and Williamson [ 36 ], the earliest MSA artefacts were found in a layer of calcareous clay with angular rubble and a wedge of sand (level 2), and in layers of sand, clay and calcareous breccia with roof-fall deposits of limestone rubble (levels 3C and 3D). The main MSA assemblage was collected in levels consisting of calcareous breccia deposits (levels 4A and 4B) and sealed by the main dripstone. Post-dripstone activity and erosion removed deposits to a depth of approximately one meter at the entrance and towards the centre of the cave, where brown loam accumulated. LSA and Neolithic artefacts were found at the top of these poorly consolidated sediments, between 0 and 60 cm below datum. In these levels, consisting of fine sands and loam with interstratified hearth material, some post-depositional mixing may have occurred [ 90 ]. However, with the exception of the cave entrance, the main MSA assemblage was sealed and stratigraphically distinct [ 36 ].  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 2. Porc-Epic Cave's stratigraphy. Eastern profile (09W-10W) at the end of the 1974 excavation. The gamma-spectrometry age of the human mandible and the obsidian hydration ages for artefacts recovered during the 1933 excavation are indicated in green and orange respectively. 14 C ages obtained from gastropod opercula are indicated in blue. Their position within the stratigraphy is approximate, as only the depth and square at which these objects were found is known, and cannot be correlated to a specific layer. This figure is similar but not identical to the image from [ 37 ], and is therefore for illustrative purposes only.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g002 Analysis of the lithic artefacts from the MSA levels of Porc-Epic Cave [ 36 , 89 , 91 – 96 ] revealed that the main raw materials exploited at the site were flint, basalt, obsidian [ 97 , 98 ] and sandstone/quartzite. Levallois, Discoid and Laminar reduction methods, employing direct hard-hammer percussion were used in the production of flakes, blades, bladelets and points. According to Desmond Clark and Williamson [ 36 ], the LSA levels can be clearly differentiated from the MSA levels due to the presence of microliths, small scrapers and outils écaillés . This, though, is not supported by Pleurdeau [ 89 , 94 – 96 ], who identifies the presence of a small number of microliths and backed bladelets in the MSA assemblage. According to this researcher, the presence of LSA features in levels attributed to the MSA may reflect a gradual evolution from the MSA to the LSA. However, recent studies [ 91 ] suggest that the presence of microliths may be the result of mixing with the overlying LSA layers, or of an intensive reduction of raw materials such as obsidian, which may occasionally produce micro-laminar blanks.  The analysis of the faunal remains showed the presence in the MSA levels of a variety of mammal taxa, suggesting the proximity of a water source and widespread grasslands. According to Assefa [ 90 ], the skeletal element profile suggests a selective transport of nutritional high-ranking elements to the site, which may have been a residential base during the MSA.  The MSA levels of the site also yielded a few human cranial fragments and a partial mandible, which exhibits a combination of modern and archaic features [ 99 ].  An accumulation of more than 400 gastropod opercula belonging to the terrestrial species Revoilia guillainopsis was found in the MSA levels. According to Assefa [ 100 ], this accumulation cannot result from natural processes and may be interpreted as evidence for symbolic behaviour, even though the analysis of the perforations shows no evidence of anthropogenic modifications.  A number of attempts have been made to radiometrically date the MSA layers (for a summary, see [ 37 ]). Three artefacts attributed to the MSA found during the 1933 excavation [ 101 ] were dated by obsidian hydration to 61,202 ± 958, 61,640 ±1083, and 77,565 ± 1575. However, this dating method is now considered unreliable [ 102 , 103 ]. The human mandible found in 1933 [ 99 ] provided a date of ca. 50 ka through high-resolution low-background gamma-ray spectrometry [ 91 ]. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon determinations for three samples of gastropod opercula from the MSA layers [ 90 ] yielded 14 C ages of 33,700 ± 300 (Beta–193517), 35,600 ± 350 (Beta–193516), and >43,200 (Beta–193518). The 95.4% probability range of the two finite ages are 38,800–37,049 cal BP, and 41,084–39,421 cal BP (IntCal13; OxCal 4.2; [ 104 ]).  Materials and Methods   Data collection, macroscopic and microscopic analysis  The material analysed in this study is curated at the National Museum of Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa. It includes twenty-three artefacts (OPT 1–4, 6–14, 16–23, OSA 5, 15; Fig 5 and S1 and S2 Figs) identified by one of us (DR) when examining the material from Williamson’s excavations [ 37 ]. Chipped stone tools bearing ochre residues were identified in the 1975–1976 material, but were excluded from this study. A permit to study the archaeological material and to export it temporarily was granted by the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritages of Ethiopia (ARCCH). Material recovered during Teilhard de Chardin and de Monfreid’s survey (1929), Breuil and Wernert’s excavation (1933), and Desmond Clark’s excavation (1974) are not analysed in this paper.

The objects' identification number is the same as presented in Figs 4 and 6 – 11 , Tables 1 – 5 , S1 and S2 Figs, S1 Table , S1 Text .  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g005 Contextual, mineralogical, technological and morphometric variables were recorded for each object, and samples of residues were collected on a number of them (see below). In particular, we collected information on the spatial and stratigraphic provenance of the artefact, type of raw material, as well as object length, width, and thickness. The location and type of modifications, as well as the location of residue were also recorded.  Characterisation of the raw material was based on macroscopic and microscopic observation of the objects.  Anthropogenic ( Fig 6 ) and natural modifications were also analysed and photographically documented using a Leica Z6 APO macroscope. We recorded the presence of flake scars ( Fig 7A ), pits ( Fig 7B and 7C ), linear impressions ( Fig 7D and 7E ), smoothed/levelled areas ( Fig 7F – 7I ), microstriations ( Fig 7G – 7I ), deep composite grooves ( Fig 7J ), and striations ( Fig 7E ). We define pits as depressions produced by a pounding action [ 82 , 106 – 108 ]. Linear impressions are elongated, irregular marks produced by a lithic edge impacting the stone surface during retouching [ 82 ]. Smoothing is the state of a surface that has lost, comparatively to neighbouring areas, irregularities and projections through abrasive action [ 82 , 106 , 109 – 111 ]. Smoothed areas may be covered in some cases by groups of superficial microstriations [ 107 , 109 , 112 , 113 ] not exceeding a width of 50 μm. Deep grooves are sub-parallel, slightly curved marks displaying on their walls multiple striae produced by the asperities of a lithic cutting edge vigorously scraping the object's surface [ 19 , 114 ]. Striations are produced by the punctual tangential contact of a sharp tool, such as a lithic cutting edge or a bone artefact, with a pebble surface [ 82 ].

Scales = 5 mm.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g007   Ochre residue sampling and analysis  Residues from twenty artefacts were sampled with a scalpel under the microscope, on areas of approximately 2 mm 2 . The sampling ( Fig 6 ) did not produce any visible damage to the objects. Sampling was easy to conduct on OPT 1–4, 6–8, 11, 16–19 and OSA 15 due to the abundance and softness of the residue, but was more difficult on OPT 9, 10, 12–14, 22 and OSA 5, due to the small amount and hardness of the identified residues.  Sampled residues were collected following two protocols: (1) by applying carbon adhesive tabs to residues loosened by scalpel blades (samples AT1–19, AT22; Fig 8 ); or (2) by placing loosened residues in sample tubes (samples T1, T3, T5–10, T12, T17, T18). The second sampling method was carried out only when residues were abundant.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 8.

Images were treated with Leica Application Suite (LAS) equipped with a Multifocus module, and Leica Map DCM 3D computer software, which allowed for images with extended depths of field.  Micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-RS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were used to characterise the composition of the residues ( Table 1 ). The combined application of these three methods allows for the identification of the mineralogical and elemental composition of inorganic residues [ 5 , 16 ] such as those present on the studied objects. These techniques are complementary in that XRD provides an overall assessment of the minerals phases present in the sample, and μ-RS identifies the mineral composition of specific particles, which may in parallel be analysed with SEM-EDS for their elemental composition, morphology and distribution. Micro-RS was applied to all samples, XRD only when the quantity of residue was sufficient for obtaining reliable results, SEM-EDS when examination of the residue under optical microscopy indicated that the sample was not or less contaminated by sediment and/or tool fragments.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Analyses conducted on ochre residue samples. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.t001 Mineralogical analyses were carried out using a SENTERRA Dispersive Raman Microscope (Bruker), equipped with an internal calibration system. The working area was examined through the integrated colour camera. Spectra were acquired with a 785 nm laser, in a spectral range from 50 to 1500 cm -1 , a laser power of 1 mW necessary to avoid thermal transformation of mineral phases, an integration time of 20 s, and with a number of co-additions ranging between 20 to 40 depending on the presence of fluorescence radiation and signal-to-noise ratio. Spectra were collected with the OPUS 7.2. software, and compared to those of the RRUFF spectra library [ 115 ] in order to identify mineral phases.  Mineralogical composition was also established by XRD using PANalytical X’pert MPD-PRO diffractometer (Bragg Brentano Theta-Theta geometry), with a copper anticathod (mean lambaKalpha = 15,418 Å). The working tension and intensity were set at 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively, and the time of analysis was of 19.30 h and 9.30 h, depending on the sample. Mineralogical phases were identified by using the routine DIFFRAC.SUITE™ EVA software package (Bruker AXS GmbH, Germany), combined with the specific powder diffraction file (PDF2) database (International Centre for Diffraction Data—ICDD, Pennsylvania, USA).  Elemental analyses were performed through SEM-EDS by using a FEI Quanta 200 with SiLi detector, and SDD-EDAX detector. The EDS analyses were performed at the same working distance (10 mm) and with the same acquisition time (100 s). Backscattered electron images (BSE) and elemental analyses were obtained under a low vacuum mode with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and 15 kV.   Upper grindstones. The six tools interpreted as upper grindstones are made of limestone, andesite, granite and ferruginous rocks ( Fig 5 no. 4, 19–23, Table 2 , Fig D in S1 Fig , Figs H–L in S2 Fig ). They are often smaller than lower grindstones ( Fig 9 ).  Pits produced by pounding ( Fig 7C , Table 3 ) are generally present on one or both ends (OPT 4, 20–22; Fig D in S1 Fig , Figs I–K in S2 Fig ), and in two cases on a margin (OPT 19; Fig H in S2 Fig ) and across the entire surface (OPT 23; Fig L in S2 Fig ). They are in some cases associated with tangential small flake scars resulting from fractures produced during pounding (OPT 20, 21; Table 3 , Figs I, J in S2 Fig ). OPT 19 (Fig H in S2 Fig ) is a fragment of a tool that accidentally split during use.  With the only exception of one object (OPT 19; Fig H in S2 Fig ), which has only one area homogeneously covered with ochre, ochre residues appear on these tools in the form of individual spots, often present on the pitted areas ( Fig 6 ). On the tools made of ferruginous rocks, they cannot be differentiated from the tools’ raw material (Figs I, J, L in S2 Fig ). Deep grooves produced by a longitudinal scraping ( Fig 7J , Table 3 ) and flat facets produced by abrasion are also present on one upper grindstone made of ferruginous rock (OPT 20; Fig I in S2 Fig ). The facets may be due to extraction of pigment powder by rubbing the object against a lower grindstone or by using it to finely powder more friable iron-rich rocks. Striations due to abrasion ( Table 3 ) are also visible on another grindstone made of ferruginous rock (OPT 21; Fig J in S2 Fig ).   Residue analysis  Under optical microscopy most residues from the ochre processing tools and ochre-stained artefacts appear as agglomerates of fine-grained powder ( Fig 8 ). These agglomerates are particularly compact in the case of residues from OPT 9, 12 and 18 ( Fig 8L, 8O and 8U , Fig I in S1 Fig , Figs A, G in S2 Fig ). Residues sampled on OPT 6 ( Fig 8H and 8I , Fig F in S1 Fig ) are instead composed of isolated coarse grains, and those from OPT 7 ( Fig 8J , Fig G in S1 Fig ) take the form of small homogenous accumulations.  Even though macroscopically only two processing tools (OPT 2, 13; Table 3 , Fig B in S1 Fig , Fig B in S2 Fig ) show the presence of yellow residues, microscopically, samples display in most cases a majority of fine red grains associated with few yellow grains ( Fig 8 ; Table 3 ). Four samples (from OPT 3, 11, 12 and OSA 5; Fig 8E, 8G, 8N and 8O , Figs C, E, K in S1 Fig , Fig A in S2 Fig ) only feature red grains and two others (one of the samples from OPT 2 –AT2A– and the sample from OPT 13; Fig 8C and 8P , Fig B in S1 Fig , Fig B in S2 Fig ) only contain yellow grains with rare red grains. All residues also contain translucent, white and black coarse particles in variable proportions ( Fig 8 ).  Elemental (Figs 10 and 11 , Figs A–G, I in S1 Fig , Figs A, B, D, K in S2 Fig , Table A in S1 Table , Texts A–G, I, L, M, O, T in S1 Text ) and mineralogical (Tables 4 and 5 ; Figs A, C, E–J in S1 Fig , Figs A, F, G in S2 Fig ; Table B in S1 Table ; S1 Text ) analyses indicate that the residues are composed of numerous minerals, including several types of oxides, aluminosilicates (clays, micas, and feldspars), silicates, carbonates, sulphates, and phosphates.

A single tool (OPT 22; Fig 10N and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig K in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text T in S1 Text ), made of an iron-rich rock, shows residues that come either from surface alteration or from use. Components interpreted as contamination from the tool, surrounding sediment and post-depositional processes are discussed in more detail in S1 Text .  Among those from the first group, samples from OPT 7 and 9 ( Fig 10I, 10J and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig G, I in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Texts G, I in S1 Text ) are very similar and almost exclusively composed of a pure earthy hematite characterised by agglomerates of iron oxide platelets. Goethite is also found on both samples. The only difference lies in the size of the platelets, smaller in OPT 7 (2–4 μm) than in OPT 9 (5–10 μm), and the presence of lepidocrocite in the sample from OPT 7. Ca and Na-rich feldspars, quartz grains, iron oxide particles in OPT 7, and plagioclase feldspars (albite, anorthite), alkali feldspars (probably microcline), quartz grains, clays from the smectite group (probably montmorillonite), iron oxide particles, and gypsum in OPT 9 probably derive from the grinding tool and the surrounding sediment.  The sample from OPT 3 ( Fig 10E and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig C in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text C in S1 Text ) contains exogenous iron-rich submicrometric particles identified as hematite associated with clay minerals from the kaolinite-serpentine group (Si, Al, Ca, K, Mg and traces of Ti) and quartz grains–cemented by iron oxides–, which probably derive from the grinding tool. Fragments of quartz grains with clean edges (5–10 μm) may be interpreted as an additive or resulting from fragmentation of grains originating from the tool.  The residue from OPT 12 ( Fig 10K and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig A in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text L in S1 Text ) features subcircular iron-rich particles, 1–2 μm in width, with Mn traces, identified as hematite and goethite, consistently associated with micrometric platelets of clay minerals (Si, Al, K, Ca, Mg), a few K-rich platelets interpreted as micas (Si, Al, K, Na), and Ca-rich feldspar particles (possibly albite). Quartz grains certainly derived from the OPT were also detected.  The sample from OPT 13 ( Fig 10L and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig B in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text M in S1 Text ) contains agglomerates of submicrometric acicular and irregular iron oxide particles with traces of Mn, identified as goethite and hematite, associated with clays (Si, Al, Na, with low contents of K, Ca, Mg, and traces of Ti). Large tabular Na-rich feldspars (possibly albite), quartz grains, and rare earth elements (La, Ce, Nd) are interpreted as originating from the tool stone.  Ochre residues from OPT 6 ( Fig 10H and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig F in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text F in S1 Text ) include grains of 55–134 μm in length containing thin platelets composed of Fe and Ti. Hematite and goethite were identified by mineralogical analysis. Agglomerates of submicrometric grains interpreted as clay minerals (Si, Al, Mg, K), possibly saponite and halloysite, coat, in places, the large oxide grains. Clay minerals do not appear to originate from the iron rich ground rock, nor from the processing tool, which make of them good candidates for being additives. Angular, coarse grains (Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Ti, with traces of Na; approximately 194 μm in length) identified as mineral phases from chlorite and pyroxene groups (probably clinochlore and augite) were also detected in the sample. These grains, commonly found in metamorphic rocks, as well as quartz and plagioclase feldspars (such as albite and anorthite), probably originate from the processing tool.  Among the samples containing two ochre types, that from OSA 5 ( Fig 10G and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig E in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text E in S1 Text ) is composed of individual, large (17–38 μm in length), and numerous small (1–2 μm in length) iron-rich particles, identified as hematite. The latter, which occasionally present an acicular morphology, are embedded in a clay matrix (Si, Al, K, Ca, with traces of Mg, Na and Ti) identified as montmorillonite. Calcite and laumontite originate from the tool. Gypsum may have grown post-depositionally. Manganese oxides (ramsdellite), alkali feldspars (possibly sanidine) and quartz grains could either come from the tool or could be part of the ochre residue.  OPT 4 ( Fig 10F and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig D in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text D in S1 Text ) includes octahedral undetermined Fe-Ti oxides with a length of 58–63 μm, and agglomerates of submicrometric grains made of hematite and goethite that are probably naturally associated with clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, and traces of K, Mg, Na). Quartz grains are interpreted as part of the ochre residue since such grains are rare in the rock composing this tool. They could come from the processed ochre fragments or represent an additive intentionally mixed to the ochre powder. The presence of gypsum is likely due to post-depositional processes.  The sample from OPT 1 ( Fig 10A, 10B and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig A in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text A in S1 Text ) is composed of two different mineral associations. The first shows aggregates of submicrometric iron oxides (Fe) identified as hematite and goethite mixed with clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, Mg, and traces of Ti and Na) from the kaolinite group, as well as micas consisting of muscovite (Si, Al, K, Na). The second is more compact, features submicrometric and large aggregates (approximately 39 μm in length) of iron oxides (Fe, Mn), plagioclase feldspars (probably anorthite), absent in the former, and does not contain titanium in the clay minerals. Calcite, and quartz are probably part of the rock composing the tool. Detected barium sulphates and carbonates could derive from surrounding sediment or post-depositional processes.  A different type of iron oxide is detected on each of the two samples collected on OPT 2 ( Fig 10C, 10D and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig B in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text B in S1 Text ). Yellow in colour, sample AT2A ( Fig 10C ) contains compact agglomerates of submicrometric acicular grains made of goethite and, occasionally hematite, with traces of Ti mixed with platy particles of clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, with traces of Mg, Ti, Na). Red in colour, the second sample (AT2B, Fig 10D ) is composed of submicrometric grains of hematite (Fe, with traces of Ti) associated with platy grains of clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, and traces of Mg, Na), taking the form of less compact agglomerates. Angular silicate grains (approximately 42–156 μm in length) identified as quartz, and undetermined Mn-rich minerals detected in both residues probably come from the OPT. This is also the case for irregular Ca-rich grains corresponding to plagioclase feldspars (Si, Al, Ca, K, Na; approximately 62 μm in length), and K-rich micas (muscovite), observed in AT2A.  Of the two ochre components identified in the sample from OSA 15 ( Fig 10M and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig D in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text O in S1 Text ), the first includes submicrometric grains of hematite and goethite (Fe with traces of Ti) associated with clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, with traces of Na, Mg) from the smectite group (probably montmorillonite). The consistent combination of iron oxides and clay minerals suggests that they come from the same rock. The second type of ochre displays large particles of Fe oxides richer in Ti, with traces of Mn (approximately 20–79 μm in length). Fine-grained agglomerates composed of submicrometric to micrometric Ba-rich sulphates (Ba, S) and dolomite were also identified, but probably originate from the tool.  In summary, SEM-EDS and mineralogical analyses identify three main ochre groups:   (1) ferruginous clay rocks (OPT 1–4, 12, 13, and OSA 5 and 15);  (2) pure earthy hematite with a low content of goethite (OPT 7, 9);  (3) isolated coarse iron oxide particles (OSA 5) sometimes containing titanium (OPT 4, 6, and OSA 15).  Differences between groups 1 and 2 are most likely due to the fact that two types of rock were processed. Group 3 is more difficult to interpret, as it may represent either an extreme in variation of ferruginous clay rocks or a different rock type.  In addition, these three categories may contain quartz, feldspars and other silicates, clays, calcite, and calcium or barium sulphates. They may originate from the processed ochre, the grindstone, loading agents, surrounding sediments, or be the result of post-depositional processes.  XRD ( Table 5 ) and μ-RS analysis ( Table 4 , Table B in S1 Table ) of samples not studied with SEM-EDS identified the same minerals found on the samples also studied with SEM-EDS (Texts H, J, K, N, P–S in S1 Text ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 1. The flow chart of the listeriosis disease model. The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

However, few ochre processing tools, ochre containers, and ochre-stained artefacts from MSA contexts have been studied in detail within a theoretical framework aimed at inferring the technical steps involved in the acquisition, production and use of these artefacts. Here we analyse 21 ochre processing tools, i.e. upper and lower grindstones, and two ochre-stained artefacts from the MSA layers of Porc-Epic Cave, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, dated to ca. 40 cal kyr BP. These tools, and a large proportion of the 4213 ochre fragments found at the site, were concentrated in an area devoted to ochre processing. Lower grindstones are made of a variety of raw materials, some of which are not locally available. Traces of use indicate that different techniques were employed to process ochre. Optical microscopy, XRD, μ-Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-EDS analyses of residues preserved on worn areas of artefacts show that different types of ferruginous rocks were processed in order to produce ochre powder of different coarseness and shades. A round stone bearing no traces of having been used to process ochre is half covered with residues as if it had been dipped in a liquid ochered medium to paint the object or to use it as a stamp to apply pigment to a soft material. We argue that the ochre reduction sequences identified at Porc-Epic Cave reflect a high degree of behavioural complexity, and represent ochre use, which was probably devoted to a variety of functions.", "citations": "Rosso DE, Pitarch Martí A, d’Errico F (2016) Middle Stone Age Ochre Processing and Behavioural Complexity in the Horn of Africa: Evidence from Porc-Epic Cave, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.

It is situated 3 km south of Dire Dawa (Ethiopia), near the top of the Garad Erer hill, 140 m above the wadi Laga Dächatu, and opens at the base of a Jurassic limestone cliff. In 1929, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Henry de Monfreid discovered the site and carried out an initial survey that identified the presence of Palaeolithic levels [ 85 ] and rock art of a \"later schematic style\" [ 36 , 86 ]. The excavation was extended by Henri Breuil and Paul Wernert in 1933 [ 87 ] and by John Desmond Clark in 1974 [ 36 , 88 ]. In 1975–1976, the trench excavated by Desmond Clark was enlarged by Kenneth D. Williamson, covering an area of approximately 49 m 2 . In 1998, new data on Porc-Epic’s stratigraphic sequence were collected during fieldwork conducted by a team from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle , Paris, and the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH) of Ethiopia [ 89 ].

The arrow indicates the entrance of the cave; c: view of the cave from its entrance (photo A. Herrero).  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g001 The stratigraphy of the site ( Fig 2 ) shows a succession of clayish, sandy levels and breccia, which were divided into seven stratigraphic units [ 36 , 37 ]. MSA artefacts were present between 60 and 220–230 cm below datum. According to Desmond Clark and Williamson [ 36 ], the earliest MSA artefacts were found in a layer of calcareous clay with angular rubble and a wedge of sand (level 2), and in layers of sand, clay and calcareous breccia with roof-fall deposits of limestone rubble (levels 3C and 3D). The main MSA assemblage was collected in levels consisting of calcareous breccia deposits (levels 4A and 4B) and sealed by the main dripstone. Post-dripstone activity and erosion removed deposits to a depth of approximately one meter at the entrance and towards the centre of the cave, where brown loam accumulated. LSA and Neolithic artefacts were found at the top of these poorly consolidated sediments, between 0 and 60 cm below datum. In these levels, consisting of fine sands and loam with interstratified hearth material, some post-depositional mixing may have occurred [ 90 ]. However, with the exception of the cave entrance, the main MSA assemblage was sealed and stratigraphically distinct [ 36 ].  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 2. Porc-Epic Cave's stratigraphy. Eastern profile (09W-10W) at the end of the 1974 excavation. The gamma-spectrometry age of the human mandible and the obsidian hydration ages for artefacts recovered during the 1933 excavation are indicated in green and orange respectively. 14 C ages obtained from gastropod opercula are indicated in blue. Their position within the stratigraphy is approximate, as only the depth and square at which these objects were found is known, and cannot be correlated to a specific layer. This figure is similar but not identical to the image from [ 37 ], and is therefore for illustrative purposes only.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g002 Analysis of the lithic artefacts from the MSA levels of Porc-Epic Cave [ 36 , 89 , 91 – 96 ] revealed that the main raw materials exploited at the site were flint, basalt, obsidian [ 97 , 98 ] and sandstone/quartzite. Levallois, Discoid and Laminar reduction methods, employing direct hard-hammer percussion were used in the production of flakes, blades, bladelets and points. According to Desmond Clark and Williamson [ 36 ], the LSA levels can be clearly differentiated from the MSA levels due to the presence of microliths, small scrapers and outils écaillés . This, though, is not supported by Pleurdeau [ 89 , 94 – 96 ], who identifies the presence of a small number of microliths and backed bladelets in the MSA assemblage. According to this researcher, the presence of LSA features in levels attributed to the MSA may reflect a gradual evolution from the MSA to the LSA. However, recent studies [ 91 ] suggest that the presence of microliths may be the result of mixing with the overlying LSA layers, or of an intensive reduction of raw materials such as obsidian, which may occasionally produce micro-laminar blanks.  The analysis of the faunal remains showed the presence in the MSA levels of a variety of mammal taxa, suggesting the proximity of a water source and widespread grasslands. According to Assefa [ 90 ], the skeletal element profile suggests a selective transport of nutritional high-ranking elements to the site, which may have been a residential base during the MSA.  The MSA levels of the site also yielded a few human cranial fragments and a partial mandible, which exhibits a combination of modern and archaic features [ 99 ].  An accumulation of more than 400 gastropod opercula belonging to the terrestrial species Revoilia guillainopsis was found in the MSA levels. According to Assefa [ 100 ], this accumulation cannot result from natural processes and may be interpreted as evidence for symbolic behaviour, even though the analysis of the perforations shows no evidence of anthropogenic modifications.  A number of attempts have been made to radiometrically date the MSA layers (for a summary, see [ 37 ]). Three artefacts attributed to the MSA found during the 1933 excavation [ 101 ] were dated by obsidian hydration to 61,202 ± 958, 61,640 ±1083, and 77,565 ± 1575. However, this dating method is now considered unreliable [ 102 , 103 ]. The human mandible found in 1933 [ 99 ] provided a date of ca. 50 ka through high-resolution low-background gamma-ray spectrometry [ 91 ]. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon determinations for three samples of gastropod opercula from the MSA layers [ 90 ] yielded 14 C ages of 33,700 ± 300 (Beta–193517), 35,600 ± 350 (Beta–193516), and >43,200 (Beta–193518). The 95.4% probability range of the two finite ages are 38,800–37,049 cal BP, and 41,084–39,421 cal BP (IntCal13; OxCal 4.2; [ 104 ]).  Materials and Methods   Data collection, macroscopic and microscopic analysis  The material analysed in this study is curated at the National Museum of Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa. It includes twenty-three artefacts (OPT 1–4, 6–14, 16–23, OSA 5, 15; Fig 5 and S1 and S2 Figs) identified by one of us (DR) when examining the material from Williamson’s excavations [ 37 ]. Chipped stone tools bearing ochre residues were identified in the 1975–1976 material, but were excluded from this study. A permit to study the archaeological material and to export it temporarily was granted by the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritages of Ethiopia (ARCCH). Material recovered during Teilhard de Chardin and de Monfreid’s survey (1929), Breuil and Wernert’s excavation (1933), and Desmond Clark’s excavation (1974) are not analysed in this paper.

The objects' identification number is the same as presented in Figs 4 and 6 – 11 , Tables 1 – 5 , S1 and S2 Figs, S1 Table , S1 Text .  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g005 Contextual, mineralogical, technological and morphometric variables were recorded for each object, and samples of residues were collected on a number of them (see below). In particular, we collected information on the spatial and stratigraphic provenance of the artefact, type of raw material, as well as object length, width, and thickness. The location and type of modifications, as well as the location of residue were also recorded.  Characterisation of the raw material was based on macroscopic and microscopic observation of the objects.  Anthropogenic ( Fig 6 ) and natural modifications were also analysed and photographically documented using a Leica Z6 APO macroscope. We recorded the presence of flake scars ( Fig 7A ), pits ( Fig 7B and 7C ), linear impressions ( Fig 7D and 7E ), smoothed/levelled areas ( Fig 7F – 7I ), microstriations ( Fig 7G – 7I ), deep composite grooves ( Fig 7J ), and striations ( Fig 7E ). We define pits as depressions produced by a pounding action [ 82 , 106 – 108 ]. Linear impressions are elongated, irregular marks produced by a lithic edge impacting the stone surface during retouching [ 82 ]. Smoothing is the state of a surface that has lost, comparatively to neighbouring areas, irregularities and projections through abrasive action [ 82 , 106 , 109 – 111 ]. Smoothed areas may be covered in some cases by groups of superficial microstriations [ 107 , 109 , 112 , 113 ] not exceeding a width of 50 μm. Deep grooves are sub-parallel, slightly curved marks displaying on their walls multiple striae produced by the asperities of a lithic cutting edge vigorously scraping the object's surface [ 19 , 114 ]. Striations are produced by the punctual tangential contact of a sharp tool, such as a lithic cutting edge or a bone artefact, with a pebble surface [ 82 ].

Scales = 5 mm.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.g007   Ochre residue sampling and analysis  Residues from twenty artefacts were sampled with a scalpel under the microscope, on areas of approximately 2 mm 2 . The sampling ( Fig 6 ) did not produce any visible damage to the objects. Sampling was easy to conduct on OPT 1–4, 6–8, 11, 16–19 and OSA 15 due to the abundance and softness of the residue, but was more difficult on OPT 9, 10, 12–14, 22 and OSA 5, due to the small amount and hardness of the identified residues.  Sampled residues were collected following two protocols: (1) by applying carbon adhesive tabs to residues loosened by scalpel blades (samples AT1–19, AT22; Fig 8 ); or (2) by placing loosened residues in sample tubes (samples T1, T3, T5–10, T12, T17, T18). The second sampling method was carried out only when residues were abundant.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 8.

Images were treated with Leica Application Suite (LAS) equipped with a Multifocus module, and Leica Map DCM 3D computer software, which allowed for images with extended depths of field.  Micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-RS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were used to characterise the composition of the residues ( Table 1 ). The combined application of these three methods allows for the identification of the mineralogical and elemental composition of inorganic residues [ 5 , 16 ] such as those present on the studied objects. These techniques are complementary in that XRD provides an overall assessment of the minerals phases present in the sample, and μ-RS identifies the mineral composition of specific particles, which may in parallel be analysed with SEM-EDS for their elemental composition, morphology and distribution. Micro-RS was applied to all samples, XRD only when the quantity of residue was sufficient for obtaining reliable results, SEM-EDS when examination of the residue under optical microscopy indicated that the sample was not or less contaminated by sediment and/or tool fragments.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Analyses conducted on ochre residue samples. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.t001 Mineralogical analyses were carried out using a SENTERRA Dispersive Raman Microscope (Bruker), equipped with an internal calibration system. The working area was examined through the integrated colour camera. Spectra were acquired with a 785 nm laser, in a spectral range from 50 to 1500 cm -1 , a laser power of 1 mW necessary to avoid thermal transformation of mineral phases, an integration time of 20 s, and with a number of co-additions ranging between 20 to 40 depending on the presence of fluorescence radiation and signal-to-noise ratio. Spectra were collected with the OPUS 7.2. software, and compared to those of the RRUFF spectra library [ 115 ] in order to identify mineral phases.  Mineralogical composition was also established by XRD using PANalytical X’pert MPD-PRO diffractometer (Bragg Brentano Theta-Theta geometry), with a copper anticathod (mean lambaKalpha = 15,418 Å). The working tension and intensity were set at 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively, and the time of analysis was of 19.30 h and 9.30 h, depending on the sample. Mineralogical phases were identified by using the routine DIFFRAC.SUITE™ EVA software package (Bruker AXS GmbH, Germany), combined with the specific powder diffraction file (PDF2) database (International Centre for Diffraction Data—ICDD, Pennsylvania, USA).  Elemental analyses were performed through SEM-EDS by using a FEI Quanta 200 with SiLi detector, and SDD-EDAX detector. The EDS analyses were performed at the same working distance (10 mm) and with the same acquisition time (100 s). Backscattered electron images (BSE) and elemental analyses were obtained under a low vacuum mode with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and 15 kV.   Upper grindstones. The six tools interpreted as upper grindstones are made of limestone, andesite, granite and ferruginous rocks ( Fig 5 no. 4, 19–23, Table 2 , Fig D in S1 Fig , Figs H–L in S2 Fig ). They are often smaller than lower grindstones ( Fig 9 ).  Pits produced by pounding ( Fig 7C , Table 3 ) are generally present on one or both ends (OPT 4, 20–22; Fig D in S1 Fig , Figs I–K in S2 Fig ), and in two cases on a margin (OPT 19; Fig H in S2 Fig ) and across the entire surface (OPT 23; Fig L in S2 Fig ). They are in some cases associated with tangential small flake scars resulting from fractures produced during pounding (OPT 20, 21; Table 3 , Figs I, J in S2 Fig ). OPT 19 (Fig H in S2 Fig ) is a fragment of a tool that accidentally split during use.  With the only exception of one object (OPT 19; Fig H in S2 Fig ), which has only one area homogeneously covered with ochre, ochre residues appear on these tools in the form of individual spots, often present on the pitted areas ( Fig 6 ). On the tools made of ferruginous rocks, they cannot be differentiated from the tools’ raw material (Figs I, J, L in S2 Fig ). Deep grooves produced by a longitudinal scraping ( Fig 7J , Table 3 ) and flat facets produced by abrasion are also present on one upper grindstone made of ferruginous rock (OPT 20; Fig I in S2 Fig ). The facets may be due to extraction of pigment powder by rubbing the object against a lower grindstone or by using it to finely powder more friable iron-rich rocks. Striations due to abrasion ( Table 3 ) are also visible on another grindstone made of ferruginous rock (OPT 21; Fig J in S2 Fig ).   Residue analysis  Under optical microscopy most residues from the ochre processing tools and ochre-stained artefacts appear as agglomerates of fine-grained powder ( Fig 8 ). These agglomerates are particularly compact in the case of residues from OPT 9, 12 and 18 ( Fig 8L, 8O and 8U , Fig I in S1 Fig , Figs A, G in S2 Fig ). Residues sampled on OPT 6 ( Fig 8H and 8I , Fig F in S1 Fig ) are instead composed of isolated coarse grains, and those from OPT 7 ( Fig 8J , Fig G in S1 Fig ) take the form of small homogenous accumulations.  Even though macroscopically only two processing tools (OPT 2, 13; Table 3 , Fig B in S1 Fig , Fig B in S2 Fig ) show the presence of yellow residues, microscopically, samples display in most cases a majority of fine red grains associated with few yellow grains ( Fig 8 ; Table 3 ). Four samples (from OPT 3, 11, 12 and OSA 5; Fig 8E, 8G, 8N and 8O , Figs C, E, K in S1 Fig , Fig A in S2 Fig ) only feature red grains and two others (one of the samples from OPT 2 –AT2A– and the sample from OPT 13; Fig 8C and 8P , Fig B in S1 Fig , Fig B in S2 Fig ) only contain yellow grains with rare red grains. All residues also contain translucent, white and black coarse particles in variable proportions ( Fig 8 ).  Elemental (Figs 10 and 11 , Figs A–G, I in S1 Fig , Figs A, B, D, K in S2 Fig , Table A in S1 Table , Texts A–G, I, L, M, O, T in S1 Text ) and mineralogical (Tables 4 and 5 ; Figs A, C, E–J in S1 Fig , Figs A, F, G in S2 Fig ; Table B in S1 Table ; S1 Text ) analyses indicate that the residues are composed of numerous minerals, including several types of oxides, aluminosilicates (clays, micas, and feldspars), silicates, carbonates, sulphates, and phosphates.

Results of XRD analyses on residues from Porc-Epic Cave's ochre processing tools and ochre-stained artefacts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164793.t005 SEM-EDS and mineralogical analysis (Figs 10 and 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Figs A–G, I in S1 Fig , Figs A, B, D, K in S2 Fig , S1 Table , S1 Text ) of the residues from twelve ochre processing tools reveals that six (OPT 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13; Fig 10E, 10H, 10I, 10J, 10K and 10L , Figs C, F, G, I in S1 Fig , Figs A, B in S2 Fig ) include element associations and morphological features indicating the presence of a single type of ochre per tool; five (OPT 1, 2, 4 and OSA 5, 15; Fig 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D, 10F, 10G and 10M , Figs A, B, D, E in S1 Fig , Fig D in S2 Fig ) display associations suggesting the presence of two types of ochre. A single tool (OPT 22; Fig 10N and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig K in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text T in S1 Text ), made of an iron-rich rock, shows residues that come either from surface alteration or from use. Components interpreted as contamination from the tool, surrounding sediment and post-depositional processes are discussed in more detail in S1 Text .  Among those from the first group, samples from OPT 7 and 9 ( Fig 10I, 10J and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig G, I in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Texts G, I in S1 Text ) are very similar and almost exclusively composed of a pure earthy hematite characterised by agglomerates of iron oxide platelets. Goethite is also found on both samples. The only difference lies in the size of the platelets, smaller in OPT 7 (2–4 μm) than in OPT 9 (5–10 μm), and the presence of lepidocrocite in the sample from OPT 7. Ca and Na-rich feldspars, quartz grains, iron oxide particles in OPT 7, and plagioclase feldspars (albite, anorthite), alkali feldspars (probably microcline), quartz grains, clays from the smectite group (probably montmorillonite), iron oxide particles, and gypsum in OPT 9 probably derive from the grinding tool and the surrounding sediment.  The sample from OPT 3 ( Fig 10E and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig C in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text C in S1 Text ) contains exogenous iron-rich submicrometric particles identified as hematite associated with clay minerals from the kaolinite-serpentine group (Si, Al, Ca, K, Mg and traces of Ti) and quartz grains–cemented by iron oxides–, which probably derive from the grinding tool. Fragments of quartz grains with clean edges (5–10 μm) may be interpreted as an additive or resulting from fragmentation of grains originating from the tool.  The residue from OPT 12 ( Fig 10K and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig A in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text L in S1 Text ) features subcircular iron-rich particles, 1–2 μm in width, with Mn traces, identified as hematite and goethite, consistently associated with micrometric platelets of clay minerals (Si, Al, K, Ca, Mg), a few K-rich platelets interpreted as micas (Si, Al, K, Na), and Ca-rich feldspar particles (possibly albite). Quartz grains certainly derived from the OPT were also detected.  The sample from OPT 13 ( Fig 10L and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig B in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text M in S1 Text ) contains agglomerates of submicrometric acicular and irregular iron oxide particles with traces of Mn, identified as goethite and hematite, associated with clays (Si, Al, Na, with low contents of K, Ca, Mg, and traces of Ti). Large tabular Na-rich feldspars (possibly albite), quartz grains, and rare earth elements (La, Ce, Nd) are interpreted as originating from the tool stone.  Ochre residues from OPT 6 ( Fig 10H and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig F in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text F in S1 Text ) include grains of 55–134 μm in length containing thin platelets composed of Fe and Ti. Hematite and goethite were identified by mineralogical analysis. Agglomerates of submicrometric grains interpreted as clay minerals (Si, Al, Mg, K), possibly saponite and halloysite, coat, in places, the large oxide grains. Clay minerals do not appear to originate from the iron rich ground rock, nor from the processing tool, which make of them good candidates for being additives. Angular, coarse grains (Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Ti, with traces of Na; approximately 194 μm in length) identified as mineral phases from chlorite and pyroxene groups (probably clinochlore and augite) were also detected in the sample. These grains, commonly found in metamorphic rocks, as well as quartz and plagioclase feldspars (such as albite and anorthite), probably originate from the processing tool.  Among the samples containing two ochre types, that from OSA 5 ( Fig 10G and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig E in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text E in S1 Text ) is composed of individual, large (17–38 μm in length), and numerous small (1–2 μm in length) iron-rich particles, identified as hematite. The latter, which occasionally present an acicular morphology, are embedded in a clay matrix (Si, Al, K, Ca, with traces of Mg, Na and Ti) identified as montmorillonite. Calcite and laumontite originate from the tool. Gypsum may have grown post-depositionally. Manganese oxides (ramsdellite), alkali feldspars (possibly sanidine) and quartz grains could either come from the tool or could be part of the ochre residue.  OPT 4 ( Fig 10F and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig D in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text D in S1 Text ) includes octahedral undetermined Fe-Ti oxides with a length of 58–63 μm, and agglomerates of submicrometric grains made of hematite and goethite that are probably naturally associated with clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, and traces of K, Mg, Na). Quartz grains are interpreted as part of the ochre residue since such grains are rare in the rock composing this tool. They could come from the processed ochre fragments or represent an additive intentionally mixed to the ochre powder. The presence of gypsum is likely due to post-depositional processes.  The sample from OPT 1 ( Fig 10A, 10B and Fig 11 , Tables 4 and 5 , Fig A in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text A in S1 Text ) is composed of two different mineral associations. The first shows aggregates of submicrometric iron oxides (Fe) identified as hematite and goethite mixed with clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, Mg, and traces of Ti and Na) from the kaolinite group, as well as micas consisting of muscovite (Si, Al, K, Na). The second is more compact, features submicrometric and large aggregates (approximately 39 μm in length) of iron oxides (Fe, Mn), plagioclase feldspars (probably anorthite), absent in the former, and does not contain titanium in the clay minerals. Calcite, and quartz are probably part of the rock composing the tool. Detected barium sulphates and carbonates could derive from surrounding sediment or post-depositional processes.  A different type of iron oxide is detected on each of the two samples collected on OPT 2 ( Fig 10C, 10D and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig B in S1 Fig , S1 Table , Text B in S1 Text ). Yellow in colour, sample AT2A ( Fig 10C ) contains compact agglomerates of submicrometric acicular grains made of goethite and, occasionally hematite, with traces of Ti mixed with platy particles of clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, with traces of Mg, Ti, Na). Red in colour, the second sample (AT2B, Fig 10D ) is composed of submicrometric grains of hematite (Fe, with traces of Ti) associated with platy grains of clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, and traces of Mg, Na), taking the form of less compact agglomerates. Angular silicate grains (approximately 42–156 μm in length) identified as quartz, and undetermined Mn-rich minerals detected in both residues probably come from the OPT. This is also the case for irregular Ca-rich grains corresponding to plagioclase feldspars (Si, Al, Ca, K, Na; approximately 62 μm in length), and K-rich micas (muscovite), observed in AT2A.  Of the two ochre components identified in the sample from OSA 15 ( Fig 10M and Fig 11 , Table 4 , Fig D in S2 Fig , S1 Table , Text O in S1 Text ), the first includes submicrometric grains of hematite and goethite (Fe with traces of Ti) associated with clay minerals (Si, Al, Ca, K, with traces of Na, Mg) from the smectite group (probably montmorillonite). The consistent combination of iron oxides and clay minerals suggests that they come from the same rock. The second type of ochre displays large particles of Fe oxides richer in Ti, with traces of Mn (approximately 20–79 μm in length). Fine-grained agglomerates composed of submicrometric to micrometric Ba-rich sulphates (Ba, S) and dolomite were also identified, but probably originate from the tool.  In summary, SEM-EDS and mineralogical analyses identify three main ochre groups:   (1) ferruginous clay rocks (OPT 1–4, 12, 13, and OSA 5 and 15);  (2) pure earthy hematite with a low content of goethite (OPT 7, 9);  (3) isolated coarse iron oxide particles (OSA 5) sometimes containing titanium (OPT 4, 6, and OSA 15).  Differences between groups 1 and 2 are most likely due to the fact that two types of rock were processed. Group 3 is more difficult to interpret, as it may represent either an extreme in variation of ferruginous clay rocks or a different rock type.  In addition, these three categories may contain quartz, feldspars and other silicates, clays, calcite, and calcium or barium sulphates. They may originate from the processed ochre, the grindstone, loading agents, surrounding sediments, or be the result of post-depositional processes.  XRD ( Table 5 ) and μ-RS analysis ( Table 4 , Table B in S1 Table ) of samples not studied with SEM-EDS identified the same minerals found on the samples also studied with SEM-EDS (Texts H, J, K, N, P–S in S1 Text ).

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).

Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

Laboratory populations were reared from these cyst samples. We assessed the reproductive mode of each population using a sex ratio criterion [29] and whenever the original cyst samples contained an additional sexual species (see Table 1 ), we obtained pure laboratory parthenogenetic populations using morphometric methods (for culture conditions and other details see [29] ). Cyst samples from Asiatic sexual species were also obtained from the same cyst bank collection, including A . urmiana from Urmia lake and from Koyashskoe lake, A. tibetiana from four lakes of the Tibetan plateau (Lagkor Co, Gaize, Hayan, Jingyu), an undescribed sexual Artemia population from Kazakhstan (originally Artemia Reference Center code - ARC 1039, unknown locality) and A. sinica from Yuncheng (China) ( Figure 1 ).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

The topology inferred by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method using HKY model is shown. Bayesian (BA) phylogenetic reconstruction showed a very similar topology.

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ).

Map shows the countries for which available sequences from HIV-1B infected patients were available (colored), and the number of sequences per country (n). Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

Laboratory populations were reared from these cyst samples. We assessed the reproductive mode of each population using a sex ratio criterion [29] and whenever the original cyst samples contained an additional sexual species (see Table 1 ), we obtained pure laboratory parthenogenetic populations using morphometric methods (for culture conditions and other details see [29] ). Cyst samples from Asiatic sexual species were also obtained from the same cyst bank collection, including A . urmiana from Urmia lake and from Koyashskoe lake, A. tibetiana from four lakes of the Tibetan plateau (Lagkor Co, Gaize, Hayan, Jingyu), an undescribed sexual Artemia population from Kazakhstan (originally Artemia Reference Center code - ARC 1039, unknown locality) and A. sinica from Yuncheng (China) ( Figure 1 ).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

The topology inferred by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method using HKY model is shown. Bayesian (BA) phylogenetic reconstruction showed a very similar topology. The ML bootstrap values higher than 50 are shown below the branch, and the Bayesian support values over 90% are shown above the branch. Haplotypes found in each population are shown, with population codes corresponding to those listed in Table 3 .

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 1. The flow chart of the listeriosis disease model. The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. The model output versus observed data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t002 In Fig 4 (based on the NICD-data) and Fig 5 (based on the density plot) we show the trajectories of the E-, I-, and R-compartments over the outbreak period. The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p . The countries included in our analyses with the corresponding number of pol p sequences used are shown in Figure 1 . A full list of GenBank accession numbers, countries of origin, and year of isolation, as well as the relevant publication associated with each sequence, is available as supplementary material ( Table S1 ). Sequence alignments were constructed using MUSCLE 3.7 [27] and adjusted manually according to the amino acid sequences using Se-Al [28] .

Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

Laboratory populations were reared from these cyst samples. We assessed the reproductive mode of each population using a sex ratio criterion [29] and whenever the original cyst samples contained an additional sexual species (see Table 1 ), we obtained pure laboratory parthenogenetic populations using morphometric methods (for culture conditions and other details see [29] ). Cyst samples from Asiatic sexual species were also obtained from the same cyst bank collection, including A . urmiana from Urmia lake and from Koyashskoe lake, A. tibetiana from four lakes of the Tibetan plateau (Lagkor Co, Gaize, Hayan, Jingyu), an undescribed sexual Artemia population from Kazakhstan (originally Artemia Reference Center code - ARC 1039, unknown locality) and A. sinica from Yuncheng (China) ( Figure 1 ).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections and we include a compartment to represent the reservoir of bacteria. Recent examples of models with vertical transmission can be found in the papers [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] for instance. Our analysis includes both theoretical mathematics as well as computer simulations. The model is calibrated to South African data.   The model  We describe our ODE compartmental model as follows. By E we denote the collection of individuals who are infected with listeriosis, but do not experience the symptoms. Those who are beyond the latter phase and are suffering the symptoms of listeriosis form a compartment I. By R we denote the removed, i.e., those who have recovered from listeriosis and have temporary immunity. This can be bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. The remaining population forms the class S of so-called susceptibles. At any given time t the sizes of these compartments are denoted by E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ) and S ( t ) respectively. The size of the population at time t is denoted by N ( t ), and then N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ). It is also assumed that the pathogen is present in the environment, over and above those that live in the form of human infection. Thus our system has another compartment B, with B ( t ) representing the abundance of the pathogen at time t . The data in the report [ 13 ] of the NICD show that in any given week the number of new infections were always below 1000, in a very large population. This has implications (mainly simplification) of our computations. Since we do not have data available to feed into the model, we work with B ( t ) just as an abstract quantity, but we now declare the (proportional) connection of B ( t ) with the concentration of the pathogen. If we write P ( t ) for the average (over the population) concentration of the pathogen in the diet, then for a suitable proportionality constant q , we write B ( t ) = qP ( t ). Here q is chosen in such a way that: (1)  The sizes of these compartments will be treated as continuous variables (rather than integers). We assume a homogeneously mixing population. We introduce non-negative constant parameters K , μ , ϕ , ψ , δ , ζ and ν . The number K is the size of the population when in disease-free state, i.e., at disease-free equilibrium. The general mortality rate is denoted by μ . In the I-compartment the mortality rate is amplified by the disease-induced mortality rate δ . Therefore in the compartments S,E,R and I respectively, the rate of outflow due to death are (resp.) μS , μE , μR and ( μ + δ ) I .  It is assumed that there is an inflow of individuals (newborns) into the system at a rate μK . Part of the inflow is into the I-class, as neonates are at risk of contracting the infection from the mother if she is infected. So let us use θ to denote the fraction of neonates from infected mothers who do contract the infection from the mother. The number of babies from infected mothers can be calculated as μI . Therefore the number of newborns entering the I-class is θμI .  We assume that the probability of an individual becoming infected with listeriosis during a short period of time [ t , t + h ] is hβ ( t ) where β ( t ) is given by (2) for some fixed positive constants c and L . This means that new infections occur at a rate β ( t ) S ( t ), and so β ( t ) S ( t ) is the rate of transfer from the S-class to the E-class. The given form of β ( t ) is also applied in modeling of cholera. The rate of transfer from the E-class to the I-class is ϕE ( t ) and the rate of transfer from the I-class to the R-class is ψI ( t ). From the R-class, individuals move to the S-class at the rate ζR ( t ). The flow chart, Fig 1 , of the proposed model shows the rates of transfer in or out of compartments.

The dashed lines indicate influences but not flow of individuals.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.g001 In the environment, the bacteria are assumed to have an effective rate of decline denoted by ν . Furthermore, the infectious class I of the human population contributes to the bacteria in the environment at a rate ξI ( t ). The factor ξ takes the form for some non-negative constants η and η 0 . Then the population dynamics of the disease is described by the system ( 3 ) of five ordinary differential equations. (3)  For notational convenience we introduce the symbol  The state of the population at any time t is a solution X ( t ) = ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), B ( t )) of this system of differential equations. As is common in compartmental ODE models, this system of equations is applicable when studying the phase subsequent to an outbreak. During the outbreak itself, the infection is imposed on susceptibles by an external force, and we follow a slightly different approach.  It can routinely be shown that the set is an invariant domain for the system. This means essentially that all the state variables will be non-negative and the total population size will never be bigger than K .    The basic reproduction number  The model has a disease-free equilibrium point, denoted by , and . The basic reproduction number R 0 of a disease in a population is defined as the number of infections caused by introducing a single infectious person into a susceptible population. It has the property that whenever R 0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, see [ 17 ]. The latter means that if the initial state of the population is sufficiently close to disease-free, then in the long run the disease will be eradicated from the system. We determine the basic reproduction number of the model ( 3 ) following the next-generation matrix method as presented in the work [ 17 ]. The vector of infectious classes is ( E , I , B ). Then the next-generation matrix is of the form FV −1 with F and V as below.   Therefore we obtain the next-generation matrix as:  Its characteristic equation is:  The basic reproduction number is the maximum of the moduli of the roots λ of the latter cubic equation. Therefore, Recall that the number R 0 serves as an indicator of local stability (or otherwise) of the disease-free equilibrium of system ( 3 ) (see [ 17 ]). We shall also refer to the following number R g , when studying global stability, proving that the condition R g < 1 guarantees global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium means that irrespective of the initial state of the population, in the long run the disease will tend towards extinction, and is a stronger condition than local stability.  In fact, as indicators of stability, the invariants R g and R 0 are equivalent as we prove below.  Theorem . (Equivalence of stability thresholds).   If  R g < 1 then R 0 < 1.  If  R g > 1 then R 0 > 1.  Proof . We can write  Then  (a) Now suppose that R g ≤ 1. Then D / μ 1 < (1 − 2 x ). Therefore,  This proves (a).  (b) This follows by a similar argument.    Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium  When working towards eradication of an endemic infectious disease, global stabilization of the disease-free equilibrium state is important. This will ensure that in the long term, the pathogen will become extinct in the population.  Global stability theorem. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium, X * = ( K , 0, 0, 0, 0), of the system ( 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable .  Proof . Let us assume that R 0 < 1. Then also R g < 1. This condition is equivalent to the inequality  Given the latter inequality there exist positive numbers b 0 , b 1 , ϵ such that (4)  We fix such numbers b 0 , b 1 , and ϵ . Now we define the following numbers:  In particular we note that  Therefore we can find a number a 0 > 0 such that a 0 ≤ b 1 and such that  We can also choose a number a 2 > 0 such that (5)  We introduce a new variable Q ( t ) = K − S ( t ) and we define a function which we shall prove to be a Lyapunov function with respect to the disease-free equilibrium point . This will suffice to complete the proof. Thus, let  Then  Noting that β = cB /( L + B ) and S ≤ K , in particular we obtain the following inequality  Also, ξ ≤ η . Therefore we obtain:  On the right hand side of the latter inequality, we note that the coefficients of Q , E and R are negative. From the inequality ( 5 ) it follows that also the coefficient of I is negative. Regarding the coefficient of B we observe:  Therefore and so by the inequality ( 4 ) the coefficient of B is negative. Thus we have shown that V is a Lyapunov function, and this completes the proof.     Existence of an endemic equilibrium point  The endemic equilibrium point has I * ≠ 0. In this case, in particular we have also B * ≠ 0. In fact for the endemic equilibrium point we have (and note that we write η /(1 + η 0  I *) = ξ *): where m = ψ + μ + δ − θμ . The values of S * and B * are calculated as follows:  (6)   Now we note the following inequality:  Thus we have shown that the denominator in the expression ( 6 ) is positive. Consequently for B * > 0 we must have cϕξ * K − ( ϕ + μ ) mνL > 0. The latter condition implies R 0 > 1, since ξ * ≤ η . It can routinely be shown that the positive equilibrum exists if and only if R 0 > 1.    Parameter values relevant to outbreak  Values of parameters of system ( 3 ) will be discussed in this section, and are presented in Table 1 . We also analyse the transmission probabilities α ( t ) for the duration of the outbreak. Since the listeriosis data [ 13 ] from the South African NICD are given per week, we choose 1 week as our unit of time (but in simulations we consistently use timestep equal to 1 day).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Numerical values of parameters. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229901.t001 From the NICD data which are reflected in Fig 3 , we fit the parameters ϕ , ψ and δ , and their values are as in Table 1 . The data also sheds light on θ . Regarding θ , simple calculations reveal that there must have been many infected babies whose mothers were not listeriosis patients. In a random sample of n the expected percentage F of babies, who in a given period of 62 weeks were less than 28 days old, is calculated as  The percentage of neonates among the infected is reported in [ 13 ] as 42% which is bigger by a factor of more than 20. This leads one to conclude that if both a mother and her neonate was exposed to L. monocytogenes , then the baby was more likely to contract the disease than the mother. In particular then, for the given scenario one would suspect that if the mother of a neonate was infected, then her child would very likely also be infected. On this basis we guess a value, θ = 0.9. The other parameters are obtained from the literature (except for L , η and ν , which are not relevant to the outbreak).  In the census document [ 18 ] the average life expectancy in South Africa is given as 61.2 years for males and 66.7 years for females. Therefore we calculate the value of the general mortality rate μ for South Africa as per week.  Members in the class R are considered at least temporarily safe from becoming infected, due to bodily immunity or through lifestyle adaptation. In the case of listeriosis there are clear guidelines for avoiding infection, generally published regularly by public health authorities, see [ 13 ] or [ 20 ] for instance. The effective duration of the temporary immunity is taken as 6 weeks, and so ζ = 1/6 per week.  Regarding the function β , it is difficult to find an optimal value for L . However, we assign to it a nominal value L = 1. Then the value of c is fixed by the definition of B ( t ): Since B = 1 corresponds to 100 new latent infections per week and we have chosen L = 1, we obtain c × 1 × 6 × 10 7 /(1 + 1) = 100. This means that c = 1/300000 (per week).  The parameters η , η 0 and ν will be given nominal values. They are not relevant to the outbreak and we shall explain them at a later stage.  Remark (a) A value for ϕ can be estimated based on the papers [ 21 ] and [ 22 ]. The incubation period of listeriosis varies quite significantly: from under 24 hours up to as much as 90 days—a study of the incubation period appears in [ 21 ] for instance. A final value is not concluded in [ 21 ]. Our fitted value of ϕ , puts the average incubation period for listeriosis at just below 5.5 days.  (b) In the study [ 22 ] it is observed that the mortality among the infected is one-third. The period post incubation, subsequent to the pathogen having taken effect, over which these deaths occur was not specified. We note that treatment for listeriosis takes 2-6 weeks (Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks, [ 20 ]). So if one takes the duration of the infectious period as 6 weeks, then it suggests a disease-induced mortality rate of 1/(3 × 6) per week. This is approximately three times the rate that we calculate for this outbreak.    Comparing the model output with reported results  In Table 2 we present three outputs of the model for comparison with reported results [ 13 ], for the period 01 January 2017 up to 08 March 2018. We give the total new cases as reproduced on the basis of the force of infection, computed using the Eq (8) above. The three outputs that we compute are the total number of cases, the total number of fatalities and the total number of recoveries. We are then able to calculate the number of remaining infectives through simple arithmetic. The outputs are calculated twice: i.e., first for rough data and then from the density plot. In both cases the outcomes compare very well with the observed data.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2.

The S-class is many orders bigger. In fact, we note that the total number of cases during the outbreak was fewer than 1000. Therefore if we consider S (0) to be 60 million, then during the outbreak S ( t ) will always be above 59999000.  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

No other HIV-1 subtypes or recombinant variants were considered in this study. Only countries with at least 4 available polymerase gene ( pol ) sequences were retained for analysis. Based on these criteria, a total of 1,610 HIV-1 partial pol sequences were selected. Sequences were collected from 774 HIV-1B infected individuals from five Central American countries between 2001 and 2010, and from 836 patients from thirteen Caribbean countries between 1996 and 2010. We focused our analysis on a region of the pol gene comprising the genomic region encoding for the viral protease ( PR) and the fragment coding for the first 334 amino acid residues of the reverse transcriptase ( RT ) (1005 nucleotides, positions 2255–3259 of HXB2 subtype B reference strain, GenBank accession number K03455), from here on named pol p .

Insert at the top right shows an expansion of the Eastern Caribbean islands. All sequences were sampled between 1996 and 2010.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069218.g001 HIV-1B prevalence data in each country was obtained using previously reported data from 2001 to 2009, the period in which most of the sequences of our data sets were collected. The consulted sources reported highly similar prevalence values. Thus, for our analyses we used those reported by the United Nations [29] , [30] .    Estimate of Nucleotide Substitution Rates and Divergence Time  Bioinformatics tools were applied to estimate nucleotide substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our HIV-1 pol p sequence data sets. The presence of temporal signal in the analyzed data sets is essential to the accurate estimate of these two parameters. Thus, we first assessed the strength of temporal signal in the Central American and in the Caribbean HIV-1 pol p data sets. To do so, we constructed maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred with PhyML [31] using Subtree Pruning Regrafting (SPR) method, incorporating the best-fitted nucleotide substitution model as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1 [32] . Clock-like behavior of the data was then assessed by regressing root-to-tip distance in the ML tree against the date of sampling of each sequence using Path-O-Gen v1.3 [33] . This analysis effectively provides a measure of the amount of variation in genetic distances explained by sampling time. To confirm the temporal signal, the BEAST analyses described below were repeated on data sets in which sampling times were randomized so that temporal structure was disrupted. Runs for randomized data were repeated 10 times.  Rates of nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), and the TMRCA were estimated for both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package v1.6.1 [34] . The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution in each case was determined using jModeltest. A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock and the flexible Bayesian skyline model as a coalescent prior were also used. In all cases, the BEAST analyses were run until all relevant parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the parameter estimates was represented by values for the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals around the marginal posterior parameter means. Substitution rates and TMRCAs were considered to be significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% HPD values of another (indicating that these rates/TMRCAs were drawn from different distributions). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, with Bayesian posterior probability values providing a measure of statistical support at each node, were also inferred using BEAST. In these MCC trees, the date of the oldest node defining a cluster of sequences from a given country was selected as the TMRCA of that country.    Analysis of Spatial Genetic Structure of the HIV-1B Populations  We also applied bioinformatics tools designed for comparative sequence analysis to explore the spatial genetic structure of the HIV-1B populations in Central America and The Caribbean. We followed three approaches:   We assessed the degree of association between country of origin and position of the sequence in the virus phylogenies using the Parsimony Score [PS, 35], the Association Index [AI, 36] and the Monophyletic Clade Size [MC, 37] statistics. PS and AI indicate the degree of phylogenetic clustering of sequences that come from the same country across the entire tree. MC assesses the association between country of origin and the virus phylogeny by estimating the size of the largest cluster of sequences coming from the same country. These analyses were performed using the program BaTS [37] , which calculates empirical distributions of these statistics from the credible sample (posterior distribution) of trees provided by BEAST. Null distributions for the three statistics were generated by using 1000 data replications.  We estimated within- and between-countries genetic diversities, by calculating pairwise distances for each pair of countries, and using the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model as implemented in MEGA 5 [38] . Standard errors of each genetic diversity measure were calculated based on 1000 replicate bootstrap. To determine if genetic diversity values were significantly different from each other, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in each case using the variance obtained by bootstrap [39] and assuming a normal distribution. We considered two genetic diversities as significantly different if the mean value of one estimate fell outside of the 95% CI of the other.  In addition, we calculated the percentage of the total genetic diversity explained by the between-countries genetic diversity using the N ST and the F ST coefficients. N ST was computed following the expression: , where δ ST is the between-countries genetic diversity and π T the total genetic diversity [39] . F ST was calculated by Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), as implemented in Arlequin v.3.11 [40] . AMOVA was also utilized to test the differences between nucleotide diversities of the virus populations in each country. Significance of these differences was obtained by performing 1000 permutations.   We tested the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance [41] , which predicts that the more geographically distant two populations of any organism are, the more genetically differentiated. We assessed the relationship between geographic and genetic distances using Mantel correlation tests as implemented in the isolation-by-distance (IBD) web service ( http://ibdsw.sdsu.edu/~ibdws/ ) [42] . Matrices of geographical distances between pairs of countries were obtained by using GenAlEx6 [43] , and matrices of genetic distances were obtained using MEGA 5 [38] . Geographic and genetic distances between pairs of populations were log transformed, and 1000 permutations were carried out to assess the significance of the correlations.    Reconstruction of Spatio-temporal Dynamics  In order to know how HIV-1B has spread across Central American and Caribbean countries, the spatial dynamics of the virus populations through time were reconstructed for both regions using two different approaches:   We performed Population Graphs analyses [44] to represent relations among populations. Population Graphs use distances between individuals or populations to construct a network of nodes, which diameter represents the within-population genetic diversity, and edges linking the nodes that are proportional to population co-variances. The resulting network leaves populations with an independent structure unconnected. This method is nonhierarchical and allows for reticulate relationships.  We employed a model of discrete diffusion in a Bayesian inference framework as implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [19] . This approach draws an explicit model describing how HIV-1B lineages, represented by the sampled sequences, migrated during their evolution across countries. The methodology employs continuous-time Markov chain models of discrete state evolution (meaning that rather than the individual GPS coordinates of each sequence being considered, all the sequences from the same country were assigned the same country state) to achieve ancestral reconstruction of these states. Inference of geographical locations throughout the evolutionary history along with a statistically meaningful measure of the confidence that can be associated with epidemiological linkage is achieved by using Bayes factors (BF) [45] . By connecting a stochastic model of discretized diffusion to standard models of sequence evolution, this method fully accounts for the uncertainty of every aspect in the underlying phylogeographic process [19] . Importantly, Population Graphs only take into account polymorphic sites, while Bayesian reconstructions use the whole sequence. The MCC trees for each data set were annotated with country state using the software TreeAnnotator (available in BEAST package). The tools available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Google_Earth were used to produce a graphical representation of the spatio-temporal movement dynamics of ancestral HIV-1B sequences.    Statistical Analysis  To discard that our substitution rate and TMRCA estimates could be biased due to either over- or under-representation of some countries, we performed BEAST analysis using a subset of sequences containing between 4 and 15 sequences per country (“balanced” subsets) in both the Central American and the Caribbean data sets. Thus, all sequences from countries with less than 15 pol p sequences were kept, and for countries with more than this number, fifteen sequences were randomly chosen. This randomization was repeated ten times and nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCAs were estimated in the ten “balanced” subsets.  We analyzed the correlation between the genetic diversity of the HIV-1B population in each country and the corresponding virus prevalence using Pearson’s correlation test. The presence of outliers, which potentially prevent significant linear correlation, was detected by calculating the studentized residual for each data point, dividing the residual by its standard deviation. Values outside the 95% CI of the Student t test distribution drawn with all of the studentized residuals were considered outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).    Age of HIV-1B Epidemic in The Caribbean and in Central America  TMRCA estimates indicated that the HIV-1B sampled diversity arose around 1990 in Central America (95% HPD = 1985–1996), and around 1980 in The Caribbean (95% HPD = 1960–1986). Therefore, our most conservative estimates indicate that the HIV-1B epidemic started not earlier than the 80 s in Central America, and not before 1960 in The Caribbean. Importantly, estimates of the “balanced” data sets yielded similar results ( Table S2 ). Our results indicated that the HIV-1B epidemic in Central America seemed to have started earlier in Honduras (1990; 95% HPD = 1985–1996) than in Panama, El Salvador, and Mexico (1994–1996; 95% HPD = 1984–1998), with the most recent introduction occurring in Belize (1998; 95% HPD = 1990–2000). In The Caribbean, our TMRCA estimates indicated that the earliest epidemic occurred in the islands of Puerto Rico and Antigua (1980; 95% HPD = 1960–1986), and the latest in Dominica (1987; 95% HPD = 1984–1990), with the HIV-1B populations in the rest of the countries showing TMRCAs within this interval of seven years ( Table 1 ). These values were not significantly different from those obtained for the countries for which TMRCAs could be estimated independently, thus validating our approach (not shown). Therefore, the HIV-1B epidemic seems to have started earlier in The Caribbean than in Central America, rapidly spreading between countries in both geographical regions (within a decade after the first introduction).   The Caribbean and Central American HIV-1B Populations are Genetically Structured According to the Country of Origin  Phylogenetic trees and AMOVA analyses indicated that the studied HIV-1B populations were genetically structured according to the geographical location (country). Genetic bottlenecks during transmission would generate the observed phylogenetic clustering by two mechanisms: (i) Selective pressures exerted, for instance, by the host’s immune system and/or ARV therapies would be different in each country [57] . As a consequence, the more fit HIV-1B variants would differ between countries, generating the observed spatial structure. There are several arguments against this idea. First, there is a lack of evidence of such differential selection [12] , [16] . Second, strong pressures selecting for variants with resistance to ARV drugs would have kept relatively constant the genetic diversity of the virus population regardless of its prevalence. That is, in spite of differences in the number of infected individuals between countries, only a few variants harboring drug resistance mutations would account for most of the HIV-1B infections in each country. However, we observed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and prevalence. (ii) Effect of genetic drift [57] . Bottlenecks during horizontal (individual to individual of the same generation) and vertical (mother to child) transmission are a well-known feature of the HIV pandemic [7] , [16] . Random transmission of HIV-1B variants due to such bottlenecks during between-countries virus jump, and/or during within-country virus transmission would have generated the observed spatial genetic structure. Interestingly, the positive association found between virus prevalence and population genetic diversity, indicating that the higher the frequency of infected individuals the higher the number of variants in the population, supports the role of genetic drift in shaping the genetic structure of the HIV-1B population in Central America and The Caribbean.  Previous analyses of the Caribbean and the Central American HIV-1B populations have failed in finding sequence clustering according to the country of origin [12] , [16] , [17] , which is probably due to the limited sample size used, both in terms of the number of countries and of the number of sequences. Based on this result, it has been proposed that the evolution of the Caribbean HIV-1B population is driven by adaptation to the main transmission mode rather than to genetic drift due to transmission bottlenecks [12] . Accordingly, the HIV-1B population from Latin America and The Caribbean, which have different main transmission modes, seems to be genetically different [17] . Although we found evidence of genetic structure at the country level in the Caribbean HIV-1B population, this is not incompatible with previous results. Rather, selection for transmission mode and transmission bottlenecks might be shaping the genetic structure of the virus population at two different levels. Adaptation to transmission mode would act at a larger inter-regional scale (i.e. geographical region scale), causing the genetic differentiation of The Caribbean population from the HIV-1B pandemic clade. Transmission bottlenecks would act at a smaller intra-regional scale (i.e. country scale), causing the genetic differentiation of the HIV-1B population between countries. Remarkably, our between-countries F ST values and those between Latin American and Caribbean HIV-1B populations are in the same range, suggesting that the strength of both forces in generating the genetic spatial structure at the two spatial scales could be similar.  It could be argued that our study does not take into account the human collective from which sequences were obtained (i.e. infants or adults; female sex workers or men who have sex with men, etc.). Thus, the observed spatial structure might be just the consequence of having different collectives sampled in different countries. However, in the majority of the countries there were representatives of two or more of these collectives. Moreover, sequences within a given country did not generally group according to the human collective sampled (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the spatial genetic structure in the analyzed regions is an artifact. "}, "conclution": "Todo", "s_files": {"Figure S1.

Genetic analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD, I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is female-biased in T. tana . The effective number of migrants between populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.  Materials and Methods   Study sites and genetic sampling  Large treeshrews are small (200–250 g), diurnal, frugivore-insectivores that inhabit the lowland tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. I collected ear clips for genetic analyses from 54 T. tana individuals at two sites in Sabah, Malaysia (NE Borneo) from 2002–2004 during a larger study on mating systems in treeshrews. The first site ( N = 39 samples) was located in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (Danum, 4°58′N, 117°48′E) and consisted of undisturbed primary lowland rainforest. The other site ( N = 15 samples) was located 53 km away in the Malua Forest Reserve (5°5′N, 117°38′E). This area was heavily logged in the early 1980's and has yet to recover the multiple closed canopies (typically 10 m and 20–30 m in height) and tall emergent trees (up to 70 m) that characterize lowland rainforests in SE Asia [48] . See Munshi-South et al.  [44] for full details of the study sites and trapping methods. This research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland, and adhered to all laws governing research in USA and Malaysia.  I extracted genomic DNA from ear tissue samples using Qiagen DNEasy tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Seven previously-described, unlinked microsatellite loci named JS22, JS132, JS183, JS188, JS196, SKTg19, and SKTg22 were amplified from DNA extracts using the PCR conditions in Munshi-South & Wilkinson [49] . Fluorescently-labeled alleles were separated on an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer and sized and scored using Genotyper 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). I also PCR-amplified a 602 bp segment of the mtDNA control region with the primers JMSTbel386 and JMSTbel1110 and PCR conditions described in Munshi-South [45] . PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer, and then sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencer 4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and Bioedit 7.0.4.1 [50] .  To examine differences in genetic variability between the primary and logged forest populations, I calculated the number of alleles and allelic richness at each microsatellite locus for each population using FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 [51] . I also used the log-likelihood G test of genotypic differentiation implemented in FSTAT [10,000 randomizations not assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, 52] to examine whether the two populations exhibited significantly different microsatellite allele frequencies. I investigated mtDNA sequence divergence between populations by calculating the number of fixed differences and shared mutations between populations, and the average nucleotide substitutions and number of net substitutions per site between populations [ D xy and D a , respectively, with Jukes–Cantor correction, 53] , using DNASP v. 4.2.4 [54] . I also conducted a permutation test (10,000 randomizations without alignment gaps) of genetic differentiation using the nearest-neighbor statistic ( S nn ) implemented in DNASP. S nn measures how often the most similar sequences in a data set (“nearest neighbors”) are from the same population, and produces a powerful test of genetic differentiation for sequence data in nearly all situations [55] .    Tests of female-biased dispersal  To test for FBD, I compared mean corrected assignment indices ( mAI c ) between adult males and females using the “biased dispersal” module in FSTAT. One-sided P values were calculated using 10,000 randomizations. The assignment index is the probability that an individual's genotype occurred by chance in a population [56] , and Favre et al. [9] applied a correction that produces mean AI c values of zero for each population. Negative AI c values characterize individuals with genotypes less likely than average to occur in a population sample, and thus lower mAI c values for one sex (females, in this case) implies sex-biased dispersal. This index was chosen because both simulations and real data sets have indicated that this test has high power at detecting moderately intense biases in dispersal [22] , [57] . Adult genotypes were used for these analyses, because this test assumes post-dispersal sampling ( N = 14 females and 20 males).  I also tested the prediction that pairs of adult females were less related on average than pairs of adult males, because sex-biased dispersal is predicted to influence local relatedness structure among adults [e.g. 25] , [27] , [58] . If female T. tana disperse more often or farther than males, then fewer closely related pairs of females should occur in the sample. I calculated two estimates of pairwise relatedness, because the performance of different estimators varies depending on population composition [59] . Two method-of-moment regression estimators, Lynch and Ritland's r  [60] and Queller and Goodnight's r  [61] , were calculated using the program MARK [62] . Simulations indicate that the Lynch and Ritland estimator performs well for most population compositions [63] . The Queller and Goodnight estimator is commonly used in studies of relatedness, and was included to facilitate comparison with other studies.  Pairwise relatedness estimates from the primary and logged forest populations were pooled to increase sample sizes, but relatedness was calculated only between pairs of individuals from the same population. Using only dyads from the same population gives a better representation of background population-level allele frequencies. For each different estimator, I tested whether mean female relatedness was lower than male relatedness using a two-sample randomization test [64] . Randomization tests were used because relatedness data were generated for dyads of individuals and thus do not represent independent observations. The one-sided P value for these tests was calculated by comparing the observed mean difference to the mean differences calculated from 10,000 randomizations of the same sets of relatedness estimates using POPTOOLS 2.6 [65] .    Tests of female-biased gene flow  If gene flow among large treeshrews is female-biased, then migration rates calculated for maternally inherited mtDNA should be higher than migration rates calculated for bi-parentally inherited autosomal markers. To test this prediction, I used the Bayesian coalescence approach implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.3 [66] to estimate the effective number of migrants exchanged per generation ( N e m ) between the two populations using both the microsatellite and mtDNA sequence data. Bayesian inference may be more accurate and efficient at sampling genealogy space than maximum likelihood approaches for many datasets [47] . This method produces estimates of Θ (4 N e μ , where μ = mutation rate) and M ( m / μ ) from microsatellite data, equaling 4 N e m when multiplied together. For mtDNA, this method estimates 2 N f m ( N f = effective population size of females). Assuming an equal sex ratio and equal variance in reproductive success among males and females, N f is equivalent to N e /2 calculated from microsatellites. Higher migration rates for mtDNA than for microsatellites should thus indicate female-biased gene flow.  To estimate the effective number of migrants from microsatellite data, I ran 10 sequential iterations in MIGRATE using a stepwise mutation model with constant mutation rates, an exponential prior distribution (Θ distribution: minimum = 0.0, maximum = 0.1, mean = 0.01; M distribution: minimum = 0.000001, maximum = 1000, mean = 100), starting parameters based on F st calculations, burn-in equaling 10,000 trees, five long chains sampling 2,000,000 genealogies, and an adaptive heating scheme (swapping interval = 1; four chains with start temperatures = 1, 1.2, 1.5 and 3). The same analysis was then repeated using the estimates of Θ and M obtained from the first analysis as starting parameters. In this second analysis, a search window for the exponential prior distribution was set according to the distribution of parameter estimates from the first analysis (Δ = 0.03 for Θ; Δ = 110 for M ). For the mtDNA dataset, I used the same analytical strategy with the F84 model of DNA sequence evolution instead of the stepwise microsatellite mutation model. However, I increased the number of sampled genealogies to 10,000,000 to achieve convergence, and used wider windows in the second run (Δ = 0.06 for Θ; Δ = 250 for M ). These analyses produced values of Θ M (4 N e m and 2 N f m for microsatellites and mtDNA, respectively) estimated in each direction between the two populations along with their approximate 95% confidence intervals [0.025 and 0.975 posterior distribution values, 66] . Following Wright et al. [67] , I then calculated the overall number of migrants per generation ( N e m ) by summing Θ M in each direction and dividing by four for microsatellites and two for mtDNA.    Female-biased dispersal  In agreement with predictions for FBD, I found significantly lower mAI c for adult females than for adult males ( Table 2 ). Mean AI c was negative for females (mean = −0.70) and positive for males (mean = 0.48), indicating that females are more likely to be immigrants than males. Two method-of-moment estimators of relatedness, Lynch and Ritland's r ( Figure 1 ) and Queller and Goodnight's r , also indicated that adult female pairs were significantly less related than adult males ( P <0.05; Table 2 ).

We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) “NSP” represents the NSP strategy, 2) “WHO” investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) “Novel Strategies” considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV “Universal Test and Treat” and 4) “Optimised” contains the most effective interventions.  Methods   Model and basecase scenario  We adapted a previously published,[ 5 ] stochastic individual-based simulation model of the transmission dynamics of M . tuberculosis (M . tb .) and fitted the model to current data on TB and HIV epidemiology in South Africa (see S1 File for full details). Briefly, the model includes TB and HIV natural history at an individual-level, with population level incidence sustained by M . tb . transmission. Latent infection with M . tb . (which confers partial protection against progression to disease following re-infection) develops into active (sputum smear negative or positive pulmonary) TB disease at a rate that is higher shortly after (re-)infection and varies with age. The model incorporated data on age-structured social mixing patterns, [ 6 ] as well as historic and projected trends in demography [ 7 ]. Timing of development of TB disease after (re-)infection is influenced by HIV status and CD4 count; HIV status and age influence the probability of TB disease being smear-positive. The model is built using C. All parameters are found in Table A in S1 File .  In terms of the natural history of TB, individuals are born without M . tb infection; can acquire an M . tb infection which may, or may not develop into active TB disease; and individuals may, or may not have their active TB disease detected and initiate treatment. The force-of-infection for TB is proportional to the prevalence of active TB, weighted by the infectiousness of each prevalent TB case. We assume age-dependent mixing between different age groups, parameterized with data from a social contact study carried out in South Africa as part of ZAMSTAR [ 6 ]. Upon infection with M . tb , individuals’ time-since-infection is tracked and they are subject to a hazard of developing pulmonary TB disease per unit time. This hazard is higher in the first 2 years following (re-)infection, with an age-dependence following that used in [ 8 ]. In subsequent years, the hazard of activation assumes a lower constant value. Individuals with an M . tb infection have a partial protection against reinfection [ 9 ], however, a successful re-infection is treated identically to an initial infection.  Upon activation to pulmonary TB, 65% of cases in 20 year olds were assumed smear positive among those without HIV infection, following the age pattern reported in [ 8 ], smear negative TB assumed 23% as infectious as smear positive TB [ 10 , 11 ]. Active TB without treatment results in death (70% for smear-positive disease; 30% for smear-negative disease) or else self-cure over a timescale of 3 years based on [ 12 ]. These alternatives are modelled as proportional hazards with a Weibull-distributed time-to-event. Self-cure leaves individuals with an M . tb infection, and acts like a new infection in terms of activation risks.  Detection and initiation of treatment in those with active TB disease is assumed to occur with a probability taken as the WHO estimate of the case-detection rate [ 13 ]. The timing of detection and treatment initiation occurs at a certain fraction of an individual’s time-to-outcome without detection and treatment (i.e. more rapidly progressing TB disease is detected proportionately more rapidly).  For PLHIV, CD4+ T-cell counts of cells/mm 3 (CD4) and TB risk were explicitly modelled, as was ART initiation and its effect on CD4 count and life expectancy by age. A proportion of PLHIV can be “linked to care” prior to qualifying for ART i . e . PLHIV who know their HIV status but have a high CD4 count. This group start ART at the national guideline threshold. The CD4 count at ART start for those detected as HIV positive with a CD4 count under the guideline threshold was taken from a distribution determined by data from a large set of ART cohorts [ 14 ]. This distribution has a median CD4 value at ART start of 152 cells/mm 3 . HIV incidence for each scenario was taken from a deterministic model of HIV transmission (see S1 File ) [ 15 ]. The model was calibrated to the situation in South Africa by varying seven key parameters (see S1 File ).  The model basecase scenario assumes continued implementation of control methods as used in South Africa up to mid-2013. This includes IPT to PLHIV at 10% coverage and ART to those PLHIV with active TB at 15% coverage by 2014. Coverage was assumed to rise to 80% coverage by 2015 to reflect the high adherence levels to ART guidelines [ 16 ]. In 2010, ART guidelines were revised from initiating those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 (2004 guideline), to < 350 cells/mm 3 with coverage to this group reaching 80% by 2012 [ 16 ]. The percentage of TB patients that were detected and started onto treatment was 69% [ 17 ]. This was independent of HIV status and was composed of both probability of detection and pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Introduction and scale-up of the GeneXpert System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was implicitly included in the basecase scenario and we assumed this had no impact on underlying parameters such as the rate at which patients start treatment as reported in the most recent South African data [ 18 , 19 ]. Parameter values are given in the Table A in the S1 File . The mean of 15,000 simulations was used for each outcome for each scenario. This number of simulations was used so that stochastic error was then reduced below that of the precision presented in the results and we could be confident in impact size to within 1%.    Interventions  Interventions were assumed to have started together on the 1 st of January 2014 and to have had short scale up times (1 year) to factor in time for preparations,[ 20 ] whilst leaving a maximum amount of time to achieve impact before the beginning of 2016. The interventions under consideration involve three separate control measures: ART, IPT, and improved TB case management. These were grouped into four portfolios of interventions for investigation, which are outlined below and in Table 1 (full details in S1 File ). The portfolios were chosen to represent groups of existing interventions that are recommended in different guidelines (NSP and WHO), or not yet in any (Novel Strategies). We then chose the most effective individual interventions and combined these into one portfolio that was predicted to give maximal impact with current tools (Optimised).  Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Summary of the interventions included in each portfolio. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t001   Portfolios   NSP. This portfolio built on the basecase scenario but with higher adherence to the control measures and additional interventions as discussed in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. IPT coverage was increased to 53% of newly detected PLHIV (as recorded in a recent HIV counselling and testing campaign)[ 21 ] and set at 36 months in duration. The additional interventions were: improved TB case management and periodic active case finding. The former assumed increased treatment success (50% reduction in treatment failure) and a decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up (by 50%). The latter assumed annual screening rounds (not just enhanced case finding [ 22 ]) reaching 30% of the population, as seen in recent HIV testing campaigns,[ 23 ] and a high sensitivity test, such as GeneXpert. When taking into account the acceptance rate of screening and pre-treatment loss to follow up, this intervention was assumed to start 16% and 12% of previously undetected smear positive/negative TB on treatment, respectively.  WHO. This portfolio was motivated by the World Health Organization guidelines on IPT duration and ART [ 24 ]. The IPT coverage was assumed to be as in the NSP portfolio, but the ART initiation guideline was increased in 2014 to a CD4 count of < 500 cells/mm 3 with coverage of those eligible reaching 90% by 2020.  Novel Strategies. This portfolio contained those interventions that are under consideration, but are not yet included in any guidelines. We built on the NSP portfolio by assuming a) ART was given universally (Universal Test and Treat, UTT): annually, 42% of PLHIV who are not on ART were assumed to start ART via this intervention. No additional TB case detection was included in this ART-only version of UTT; b) Continuous IPT was provided to 53% of PLHIV and c) 6 months of IPT was also provided randomly to the HIV negative population with 20% coverage to investigate the potential new use of a currently existing therapy, shown recently to be highly effective [ 25 ].  Optimised. This portfolio combined the most effective interventions at the realistic coverage levels considered in the other portfolios, with an additional high coverage for periodic case finding as this is advocated for in the National Strategic Plan [ 4 ]. It assumed the basecase scenario plus a) UTT; b) 6 months IPT to 20% of HIV negatives; c) continuous IPT to 53% of PLHIV on starting ART; d) 50% decrease in pre-treatment loss to follow-up and an increase in treatment success (a 50% decrease in treatment failure), and e) high coverage (60%) periodic active case finding, with a high sensitivity test such as GeneXpert, starting, annually, 32% and 24% of undetected sputum smear positive/negative TB on treatment.    Sensitivity analysis  We evaluated the robustness of our conclusions by exploring the “NSP” portfolio impact using a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters. Full details are in the S1 File .    Intervention Portfolios  Our results suggest, that the “Novel Strategies” and “WHO” portfolios could result in 32% and 22% reductions in TB incidence by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). Both portfolios peak in impact before 2032 and neither achieved greater than 40% reductions in TB incidence or mortality at any time point. The other two portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) had a much larger impact by 2016 ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2016, the “NSP” portfolio resulted in the prevention of a large number of TB deaths (57%) but only a 32% reduction TB incidence.

Percentage reduction in TB incidence and mortality in each portfolio compared to 2012 levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122514.t002 The final, “Optimised”, portfolio nearly achieved the 2016 NSP goals with a 46% and 71% reduction in incidence and mortality respectively ( Fig 1 and Table 2 ). By 2050, both TB incidence and mortality could be reduced by more than 75% using the “Optimised” portfolio. However, TB incidence and mortality remained greater than the required zero new cases and deaths NSP target for 2032.  When the portfolios were broken down into their contributing interventions, we found that for the high impact portfolios (“NSP” and “Optimised”) most of the impact (on both incidence and mortality) was attributed to reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up and to periodic (annual) active case finding. In the “NSP” portfolio ~40% of the impact was attributed to the former and ~40% to the latter at low coverage ( Fig 2 , see S1 File for other portfolio breakdowns).

We amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and two nuclear genes (internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1, and Na + /K + ATPase).  The COI fragment was amplified using the primers HCO2198 and LCOI490 [37] . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.05 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM). The cycling profile consisted of one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 20 s at 50°C, and 30 s at 72°C, with a final step of 5 min at 72°C.  PCR of the ITS1 region was performed using primers PTF and PTR [38] in a total volume of 30 µl consisting of 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.03 U of Taq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 1.5 mM) using the following conditions: a cycle of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 95°C, 50 s at 59°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final step of 7 min at 72°C.  A fragment of 280-bp, representing exon-7 of Na + /K + ATPase, was amplified using the primers designed by [33] . PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 3 µl of template DNA, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.02 U of T aq polymerase (Bioline) and 10×Bioline buffer (producing a MgCl 2 final concentration of 2 mM) using the following program: 94°C for 2 min, 32 cycles at 94°C for 25 s followed by 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°for 3 min.  All amplifications were performed on a Verity 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The electrophoregrams were checked by eye using CodonCode Aligner v. 3.5 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA). COI and ITS1 sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (for Accession Numbers see Tables 2 and 3 ) and all alignments are available in Dryad ( http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kd0k4 ).

For the nuclear markers we sequenced a subset of these individuals, 44 for the ITS1 region (two for each population sampled) and 63 for the Na + /K + ATPase fragment ( Table 3 ).  To the COI marker alignment we also added 55 published available sequences from GenBank (parthenogenetic rare males and females KC193638-KC193677, parthenogenetic haplotypes DQ426824-DQ426826, haplotypes from parthenogenetic populations and from Artemia sp. Kazakhstan GU591380-GU591389 and A.tibetiana EF615588-89). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA5 [39] using the default settings and checked by eye. The number of polymorphic and parsimony informative sites was computed with MEGA5. Patterns of nucleotide diversity, synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, population haplotype and nucleotide diversity were computed using DnaSP5 [40] .  Before phylogenetic reconstruction, sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox v.1.40 [41] . For both COI and ITS1 markers, phylogenetic analysis was implemented using Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches in MEGA5 and Bayesian approaches in MrBayes v 3.2.2 [42] on the Cipres Science Gateway portal [43] . We estimated the best-scoring ML tree using the model selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. The robustness of the branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. For Bayesian analysis we used the default parameters on the Cipres gateway. In two simultaneous runs, four Markov chains (one cold and three heated) were started from a random tree and run for 1,000,000 generations with sampling frequency every 100 generations. The first 2500 trees were discarded as burn-in.  In addition, we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype network for COI using TCS v. 1.21 [44] to visualize the genealogical relationships between the mitochondrial haplotypes. For this analysis we used all the COI sequences generated here, two A. tibetiana sequences from GenBank (EF615587-8), the sequences from Maccari et al. [29] and Muñoz et al. [30] . For sequences from the latter paper, including Mediterranean populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia , we reconstructed the sequence of each individual from the paper haplotype information.    ITS-1  The ITS1 sequences, excluding gaps in the alignment, ranged from 991 ( A. tibetiana , Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan, A. urmiana from Koyashskoe lake and all the parthenogens) to 1000 bp ( A. sinica ), including the sequences of A. urmiana from Urmia lake which have a variable length (994–999 bp). The final ITS1 alignment was 1002 bp long, with 34 variable sites and 28 parsimony informative sites and collapsed into 14 haplotypes. Evidence of heterozygosity was found in 5 parthenogenetic populations and allele identification in these was straightforward ( Table 3 ).  Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, we collapsed identical haplotypes for each population. Both phylogenetic reconstructions (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis) had a virtually identical topology and branch support ( Figure 5 ). The ML tree was obtained using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model, the one selected by the inbuilt model generator in MEGA5. It showed A. sinica as the most divergent species. The remaining samples were very closely related. The parthenogenetic samples had a total of nine very closely related haplotypes, one of them found in nine populations, was shared with both Artemia sp. from Kazakhstan and one of the haplotypes from the Iranian A. urmiana , although this latter haplotype contained an indel. The populations of A. urmiana from Koyashskoe Lake and A. tibetiana present different haplotypes, although still closely related to the parthenogenetic ones.

The topology inferred by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method using HKY model is shown. Bayesian (BA) phylogenetic reconstruction showed a very similar topology. The ML bootstrap values higher than 50 are shown below the branch, and the Bayesian support values over 90% are shown above the branch. Haplotypes found in each population are shown, with population codes corresponding to those listed in Table 3 . Sequences corresponding to heterozygous individuals are noted with the polymorphic site in parenthesis.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083348.g005"}, "conclution": "Todo", "s_files": "none", "issn": "Todo"}
